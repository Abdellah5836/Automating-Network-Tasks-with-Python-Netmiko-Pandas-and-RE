🐍 Sharing My Python Code: Automating Cisco Device Information Extraction 🌐

👋 I'm excited to share a Python code that I recently developed to automate the process of connecting to multiple Cisco devices, extracting information using regular expressions, and storing the results in an Excel file using Pandas. 🚀

Problem Statement:
managing and extracting information from multiple Cisco devices can be time-consuming. To streamline this process, I created a Python script that connects to Cisco devices, uses regular expressions to extract relevant information, and saves the results in an Excel file.

Code Overview:
I utilized the netmiko module, a multi-vendor library for SSH connections, to establish secure connections with the Cisco devices. Additionally, I leveraged the power of regular expressions to efficiently extract specific data from the device outputs. Finally, I used the pandas library to organize and write the extracted information into an Excel file.
